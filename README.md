# PS2 Event Streaming Service Docs

Unofficial AsyncAPI specification and documentation provider for the PlanetSide 2 WebSocket API.

***

An HTML version of this specification is automatically built with AsyncAPI-generator and hosted [on GitHub pages](leonhard-s.github.io/ps2-ess-api/).

## Client Generation

The provided spec is **not** sufficient to generate useful clients from it. The ESS predates many of the plug-and-play patterns for automatically generated clients or servers.

However, the schemas available under `components.schemas` should be accurate and can be used for payload validation and type conversion.

## Contributing

Contributions of any form are always appreciated and vital to the project, be it corrections, improved examples, or poorly documented features.

If you are unfamiliar with the AsyncAPI 3.x syntax, feel free to just create an issue with your changes and have someone else sort it out.
